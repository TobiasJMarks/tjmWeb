# tjmWeb
this is a demo site for my own freelance web page that advertises my services as a web developer
It's a simple design, I made it my self from scratch, no templates were used.
I had a problem with running it on github pages, the slideshow that should appear on the landing page won't display.
other than that it's preety good.
Also it isn't finished.

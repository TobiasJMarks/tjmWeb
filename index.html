          <h3>Who?</h3>
          <p class="color">Toby Marks is a Perth (Whadjuk Boodjar) born web developer currently residing in Cordoba Capital, Argentina. In 2017 He started his journey into the world of web developmet/design. Initialy focusing on web design he was wisped away on the endless zepher that is web development. His time in the industry has taken him from the humble begginings of Content management services(CMS), html and css to the far more complex world of Javascript and it's many libraries and frameworks. He currently works with vanilla Javascript, React and Jquery.
          When he's not writing code or building websites he might be found playing with his four year old daughter, teaching english, sitting in a comfortable chair reading a book drinking yerba mate. He also builds objects and tables from terrazzo. The truth is he's not as busy as it sounds.
          If you want to follow him on Instagram or twitter you can see what few things he posts :)
